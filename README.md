# IPCV_project - Image Processing and Computer Vision project

3D face Reconstruction is a widely researched topic in Image Processing today. However, its applicability spans various fields, from face recognition technology used in security systems and smartphones to medical applications for grading facial paralysis due to neurological disorders. In this paper, we explore the possibility of using three images of subjects from different points of view to reconstruct a 3D face. We discuss the employed methods along with their results and their limitations.
